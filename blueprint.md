# **Dujjonku (Dubai Chewy Cookie) Recipe Simulation Project**

## **Overview**
A specialized web application dedicated to the "Dujjonku" (Dubai Chewy Cookie) recipe, popular for its unique texture and association with IVE's Jang Wonyoung. The site offers an interactive recipe simulation for different variations of the cookie.

## **Project Outline**
*   **Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3 (Modern Flexbox/Grid), Vanilla JavaScript.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Bilingual Support:** Full Korean and English translation using `data-ko` and `data-en` attributes.
    *   **Recipe Variations:** Classic (Kadaif), Breadcrumb, and Vermicelli versions.
    *   **Interactive Simulation:** A step-by-step cooking guide with progress tracking and estimated times.
    *   **Visual Design:** Purple/Pink theme inspired by the dessert's aesthetic and Jang Wonyoung's "Kitty Dujjonku" vibe.
    *   **Mobile Responsive:** Fully functional across desktop and mobile devices.

## **Current State Analysis**
*   `index.html`: Contains the bilingual structure, introduction, tools list, recipe selection cards, and the simulation container.
*   `styles.css`: Implements a modern, clean look with gradients, sticky headers, and responsive grid layouts.
*   `script.js`: Manages language switching, recipe data (ingredients and steps), and the logic for the step-by-step simulation.

## **Planned Improvements**
*   (To be determined based on user feedback)
